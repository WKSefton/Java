Part 2

1. c. Call the bark method in TestDog, for both objects. What do the error messages mean?
	object a is an Animal object and has no bark() method
	object b is a Dog object but its reference type is Animal so again there is no bark() method

1. f. Why does it work?
	making the new object bark and move works because it is only using methods that are
	defined in the Dog class and when its created its reference is Dog instead of Animal.
